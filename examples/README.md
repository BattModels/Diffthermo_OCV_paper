## Examples

For each of these folders, look at the `main.py` script: that is the script used to fit all the models. Output OCV models can be found in `fitted_ocv_functions.py`.

Fit_graphite_OCV (deprecated): fit ocv model for graphite with R-K polynomials.

Fit_graphite_OCV_with_Legendre: fit ocv model for graphite with Legendre polynomials.

Fit_graphite_OCV_with_Chebyshev: fit ocv model for graphite with Chebyshev polynomials.
