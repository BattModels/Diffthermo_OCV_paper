RK_Plett_LFP.npz: skewed RK for LFP, from Plett's textbook, violating region x=[0.08, 0.16]

RK_Plett_graphite.npz: skewed RK for MCMB, from Plett's textbook, violating region x=[0.20, 0.60]

RK_Plett_LTO.npz: skewed RK for LTO, from Plett's textbook, violating region x=[0.00, 0.20]

RK_Plett_LCO.npz: skewed RK for LCO, from Plett's textbook, violating region x=[0.00, 0.20]

RK_Plett_LMO.npz: skewed RK for LMO, from Plett's textbook, violating region x=[0.04, 0.20]

<!-- RK_Plett_NCA.npz: skewed RK for NCA, from Plett's textbook, violating region x=[0.10, 0.20]  # this fit is probably problematic itself, it's so off -->

RK_Plett_NMC.npz: skewed RK for NMC, from Plett's textbook, violating region x=[0.04, 0.40] and
